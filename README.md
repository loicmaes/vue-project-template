# VueJS Project template

## Why was it built?

This template was built to improve my productivity and avoid repetitive stuff.

## How to setup a project with this template?

Use the GitHub template (if you have any access to it) or clone this repository using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://www.github.com/loicmaes/vue-project-template.git
```

## What does it change?

This template have a built-in reset CSS and is directly applied on the global APP.  
If you need to use a font, just import it in the [index.html](./public/index.html) file and setup the font in the proper file (unavailable now).

## Has it some built-in components and theme?

Not for now, but I'll improve it later and you could find some templates with built-in components and color schemes. A futur CSS framework and components design will appear on my [GitHub Page](https://www.github.com/loicmaes/) soon.
